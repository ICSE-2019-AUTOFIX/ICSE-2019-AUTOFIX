#Results of our approach

The results are fixed bugsby our approach. The bug with mark "Buggy position known" is the bug that we can fix only when we directly know the bug position instead of using fault localization tool to get. This result is used to compare with deep learning approach based baselines.

The results we have now:
With fault localization: 30 Fixed
With buggy postion directly: 40 Fixed

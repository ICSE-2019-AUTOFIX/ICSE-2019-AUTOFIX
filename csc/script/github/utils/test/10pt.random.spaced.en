Returns the parameters that define the model . Returns ------- params : list A list of ( Theano shared variable ) parameters of the model . Notes ----- By default , this returns a copy of the _params attribute , which individual models can simply fill with the list of model parameters . Alternatively , models may override ` get_params ` , so this should be considered the public interface to model parameters -- directly accessing or modifying _params is at-your-own-risk , as it may or may not exist . This is the main mechanism by which generic training algorithms like SGD know which values to update , however , even model parameters that should not be learned ought to be included here , so that the model ' s parameter set is more predictable . Parameters may be included here but held constant during learning via the ` modify_updates ` method .

Read SQL query or database table into a DataFrame . Parameters ---------- sql : string SQL query or SQLAlchemy Selectable ( select or text object ) to be executed , or database table name . con : SQLAlchemy connectable ( engine/connection ) or database string URI or DBAPI2 connection ( fallback mode ) Using SQLAlchemy makes it possible to use any DB supported by that library . If a DBAPI2 object , only sqlite3 is supported . index_col : string or list of strings , optional , default: None Column ( s ) to set as index ( MultiIndex ) coerce_float : boolean , default True Attempt to convert values to non-string , non-numeric objects ( like decimal . Decimal ) to floating point , useful for SQL result sets params : list , tuple or dict , optional , default: None List of parameters to pass to execute method . The syntax used to pass parameters is database driver dependent . Check your database driver documentation for which of the five syntax styles , described in PEP 249 ' s paramstyle , is supported . Eg . for psycopg2 , uses % ( name ) s so use params= { ' name ' : ' value ' } parse_dates : list or dict , default: None - List of column names to parse as dates - Dict of ` ` { column_name: format string } ` ` where format string is strftime compatible in case of parsing string times or is one of ( D , s , ns , ms , us ) in case of parsing integer timestamps - Dict of ` ` { column_name: arg dict } ` ` , where the arg dict corresponds to the keyword arguments of :func: ` pandas . to_datetime ` Especially useful with databases without native Datetime support , such as SQLite columns : list , default: None List of column names to select from sql table ( only used when reading a table ) . chunksize : int , default None If specified , return an iterator where ` chunksize ` is the number of rows to include in each chunk . Returns ------- DataFrame Notes ----- This function is a convenience wrapper around ` ` read_sql_table ` ` and ` ` read_sql_query ` ` ( and for backward compatibility ) and will delegate to the specific function depending on the provided input ( database table name or sql query ) . The delegated function might have more specific notes about their functionality not listed here .

Each subsequent positional argument is another model , or a reference to another model - see ` resolve_relation ( ) ` for the various forms these may take . Any relative references will be resolved relative to ` model ` .

Specifying ordering Specify default ordering for a model using the ` ` ordering ` ` attribute , which should be a list or tuple of field names . This tells Django how to order ` ` QuerySet ` ` results . If a field name in ` ` ordering ` ` starts with a hyphen , that field will be ordered in descending order . Otherwise , it ' ll be ordered in ascending order . The special-case field name ` ` " ? " ` ` specifies random order . The ordering attribute is not required . If you leave it off , ordering will be undefined -- not random , just undefined .

Cross-validated Lasso , using the LARS algorithmThe optimization objective for Lasso is:: ( 1 / ( 2 * n_samples ) ) * ||y - Xw||^2_2 + alpha * ||w||_1 Read more in the :ref: ` User Guide <least_angle_regression> ` . Parameters ---------- fit_intercept : boolean whether to calculate the intercept for this model . If set to false , no intercept will be used in calculations ( e . g . data is expected to be already centered ) . positive : boolean ( default=False ) Restrict coefficients to be >= 0 . Be aware that you might want to remove fit_intercept which is set True by default . Under the positive restriction the model coefficients do not converge to the ordinary-least-squares solution for small values of alpha . Only coeffiencts up to the smallest alpha value ( ` ` alphas_ [ alphas_ > 0 . ] . min ( ) ` ` when fit_path=True ) reached by the stepwise Lars-Lasso algorithm are typically in congruence with the solution of the coordinate descent Lasso estimator . As a consequence using LassoLarsCV only makes sense for problems where a sparse solution is expected and/or reached . verbose : boolean or integer , optional Sets the verbosity amount normalize : boolean , optional , default False If True , the regressors X will be normalized before regression . This parameter is ignored when ` fit_intercept ` is set to False . When the regressors are normalized , note that this makes the hyperparameters learnt more robust and almost independent of the number of samples . The same property is not valid for standardized data . However , if you wish to standardize , please use ` preprocessing . StandardScaler ` before calling ` fit ` on an estimator with ` normalize=False ` . precompute : True | False | ' auto ' | array-like Whether to use a precomputed Gram matrix to speed up calculations . If set to ` ` ' auto ' ` ` let us decide . The Gram matrix can also be passed as argument . max_iter : integer , optional Maximum number of iterations to perform . cv : int , cross-validation generator or an iterable , optional Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy . Possible inputs for cv are: - None , to use the default 3-fold cross-validation , - integer , to specify the number of folds . - An object to be used as a cross-validation generator . - An iterable yielding train/test splits . For integer/None inputs , :class: ` KFold ` is used . Refer :ref: ` User Guide <cross_validation> ` for the various cross-validation strategies that can be used here . max_n_alphas : integer , optional The maximum number of points on the path used to compute the residuals in the cross-validation n_jobs : integer , optional Number of CPUs to use during the cross validation . If ` ` -1 ` ` , use all the CPUs eps : float , optional The machine-precision regularization in the computation of the Cholesky diagonal factors . Increase this for very ill-conditioned systems . copy_X : boolean , optional , default True If True , X will be copied; else , it may be overwritten . Attributes ---------- coef_ : array , shape ( n_features , ) parameter vector ( w in the formulation formula ) intercept_ : float independent term in decision function . coef_path_ : array , shape ( n_features , n_alphas ) the varying values of the coefficients along the path alpha_ : float the estimated regularization parameter alpha alphas_ : array , shape ( n_alphas , ) the different values of alpha along the path cv_alphas_ : array , shape ( n_cv_alphas , ) all the values of alpha along the path for the different folds cv_mse_path_ : array , shape ( n_folds , n_cv_alphas ) the mean square error on left-out for each fold along the path ( alpha values given by ` ` cv_alphas ` ` ) n_iter_ : array-like or int the number of iterations run by Lars with the optimal alpha . Notes ----- The object solves the same problem as the LassoCV object . However , unlike the LassoCV , it find the relevant alphas values by itself . In general , because of this property , it will be more stable . However , it is more fragile to heavily multicollinear datasets . It is more efficient than the LassoCV if only a small number of features are selected compared to the total number , for instance if there are very few samples compared to the number of features .

Ridge regression with built-in cross-validation . By default , it performs Generalized Cross-Validation , which is a form of efficient Leave-One-Out cross-validation . Read more in the :ref: ` User Guide <ridge_regression> ` . Parameters ---------- alphas : numpy array of shape [ n_alphas ] Array of alpha values to try . Regularization strength; must be a positive float . Regularization improves the conditioning of the problem and reduces the variance of the estimates . Larger values specify stronger regularization . Alpha corresponds to ` ` C^-1 ` ` in other linear models such as LogisticRegression or LinearSVC . fit_intercept : boolean Whether to calculate the intercept for this model . If set to false , no intercept will be used in calculations ( e . g . data is expected to be already centered ) . normalize : boolean , optional , default False If True , the regressors X will be normalized before regression . This parameter is ignored when ` fit_intercept ` is set to False . When the regressors are normalized , note that this makes the hyperparameters learnt more robust and almost independent of the number of samples . The same property is not valid for standardized data . However , if you wish to standardize , please use ` preprocessing . StandardScaler ` before calling ` fit ` on an estimator with ` normalize=False ` . scoring : string , callable or None , optional , default: None A string ( see model evaluation documentation ) or a scorer callable object / function with signature ` ` scorer ( estimator , X , y ) ` ` . cv : int , cross-validation generator or an iterable , optional Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy . Possible inputs for cv are: - None , to use the efficient Leave-One-Out cross-validation - integer , to specify the number of folds . - An object to be used as a cross-validation generator . - An iterable yielding train/test splits . For integer/None inputs , if ` ` y ` ` is binary or multiclass , :class: ` StratifiedKFold ` used , else , :class: ` KFold ` is used . Refer :ref: ` User Guide <cross_validation> ` for the various cross-validation strategies that can be used here . gcv_mode : { None , ' auto ' , ' svd ' , eigen ' } , optional Flag indicating which strategy to use when performing Generalized Cross-Validation . Options are:: ' auto ' : use svd if n_samples > n_features or when X is a sparse matrix , otherwise use eigen ' svd ' : force computation via singular value decomposition of X ( does not work for sparse matrices ) ' eigen ' : force computation via eigendecomposition of X^T X The ' auto ' mode is the default and is intended to pick the cheaper option of the two depending upon the shape and format of the training data . store_cv_values : boolean , default=False Flag indicating if the cross-validation values corresponding to each alpha should be stored in the ` cv_values_ ` attribute ( see below ) . This flag is only compatible with ` cv=None ` ( i . e . using Generalized Cross-Validation ) . Attributes ---------- cv_values_ : array , shape = [ n_samples , n_alphas ] or \ shape = [ n_samples , n_targets , n_alphas ] , optional Cross-validation values for each alpha ( if ` store_cv_values=True ` and \ ` cv=None ` ) . After ` fit ( ) ` has been called , this attribute will \ contain the mean squared errors ( by default ) or the values of the \ ` { loss , score } _func ` function ( if provided in the constructor ) . coef_ : array , shape = [ n_features ] or [ n_targets , n_features ] Weight vector ( s ) . intercept_ : float | array , shape = ( n_targets , ) Independent term in decision function . Set to 0 . 0 if ` ` fit_intercept = False ` ` . alpha_ : float Estimated regularization parameter .

Cohen ' s kappa: a statistic that measures inter-annotator agreement . This function computes Cohen ' s kappa [ 1 ] _ , a score that expresses the level of agreement between two annotators on a classification problem . It is defined as . . math:: \kappa = ( p_o - p_e ) / ( 1 - p_e ) where :math: ` p_o ` is the empirical probability of agreement on the label assigned to any sample ( the observed agreement ratio ) , and :math: ` p_e ` is the expected agreement when both annotators assign labels randomly . :math: ` p_e ` is estimated using a per-annotator empirical prior over the class labels [ 2 ] _ . Read more in the :ref: ` User Guide <cohen_kappa> ` . Parameters ---------- y1 : array , shape = [ n_samples ] Labels assigned by the first annotator . y2 : array , shape = [ n_samples ] Labels assigned by the second annotator . The kappa statistic is symmetric , so swapping ` ` y1 ` ` and ` ` y2 ` ` doesn ' t change the value . labels : array , shape = [ n_classes ] , optional List of labels to index the matrix . This may be used to select a subset of labels . If None , all labels that appear at least once in ` ` y1 ` ` or ` ` y2 ` ` are used . weights : str , optional List of weighting type to calculate the score . None means no weighted; " linear " means linear weighted; " quadratic " means quadratic weighted . Returns ------- kappa : float The kappa statistic , which is a number between -1 and 1 .

alias_map is the most important data structure regarding joins . It ' s used for recording which joins exist in the query and what types they are . The key is the alias of the joined table ( possibly the table name ) and the value is a Join-like object ( see sql . datastructures . Join for more information ) . Sometimes the query contains references to aliases in outer queries ( as a result of split_exclude ) . Correct alias quoting needs to know these aliases too .

Ordinarily , we ' d use ` override_settings ( ) ` to override STATIC_URL , which is what the staticfiles storage backend is using to construct the URL . Unfortunately , other parts of the system are caching this value on module load , which can cause other tests to fail . To ensure that this change doesn ' t affect other tests , we patch the ` url ( ) ` method directly instead .

Functions and attributes used in this execution module seem to have been added as of psutil 0 . 3 . 0 , from an inspection of the source code . Only make this module available if the version of psutil is >= 0 . 3 . 0 .

Robustly test whether an object is iterable . Parameters ---------- obj : object The object to be checked . Returns ------- is_iterable : bool ` True ` if the object is iterable , ` False ` otherwise . Notes ----- This tests iterability by calling ` iter ( ) ` and catching a ` TypeError ` . Various other ways might occur to you , but they all have flaws: * ` hasattr ( obj , ' __len__ ' ) ` will fail for objects that can be iterated on despite not knowing their length a priori . * ` hasattr ( obj , ' __iter__ ' ) ` will fail on objects like Theano tensors that implement it solely to raise a ` TypeError ` ( because Theano tensors implement ` __getitem__ ` semantics , Python 2 . x will try to iterate on them via this legacy method if ` __iter__ ` is not defined ) . * ` hasattr ` has a tendency to swallow other exception-like objects ( ` KeyboardInterrupt ` , etc . ) anyway , and should be avoided for this reason in Python 2 . x , but ` getattr ( ) ` with a sentinel value suffers from the exact same pitfalls above .

Extracts patches of any n-dimensional array in place using strides . Given an n-dimensional array it will return a 2n-dimensional array with the first n dimensions indexing patch position and the last n indexing the patch content . This operation is immediate ( O ( 1 ) ) . A reshape performed on the first n dimensions will cause numpy to copy data , leading to a list of extracted patches . Read more in the :ref: ` User Guide <image_feature_extraction> ` . Parameters ---------- arr : ndarray n-dimensional array of which patches are to be extracted patch_shape : integer or tuple of length arr . ndim Indicates the shape of the patches to be extracted . If an integer is given , the shape will be a hypercube of sidelength given by its value . extraction_step : integer or tuple of length arr . ndim Indicates step size at which extraction shall be performed . If integer is given , then the step is uniform in all dimensions . Returns ------- patches : strided ndarray 2n-dimensional array indexing patches on first n dimensions and containing patches on the last n dimensions . These dimensions are fake , but this way no data is copied . A simple reshape invokes a copying operation to obtain a list of patches: result . reshape ( [ -1 ] + list ( patch_shape ) )

Check the score that comes from the ScoresClient ( out of CSM ) . If an entry exists and has a total associated with it , we trust that value .

We have a valid score , just use it . We don ' t have a valid score entry but we know from our cache what the max possible score is , so they ' ve earned 0 . 0 / cached_max_score This means we don ' t have a valid score entry and we don ' t have a cached_max_score on hand . We know they ' ve earned 0 . 0 points on this , but we need to instantiate the module ( i . e . load student state ) in order to find out how much it was worth .

Model for a single outcome service associated with an LTI consumer . Note that a given consumer may have more than one outcome service URL over its lifetime , so we need to store the outcome service separately from the LtiConsumer model . An outcome service can be identified in two ways , depending on the information provided by an LTI launch . The ideal way to identify the service is by instance_guid , which should uniquely identify a consumer . However that field is optional in the LTI launch , and so if it is missing we can fall back on the consumer key ( which should be created uniquely for each consumer although we don ' t have a technical way to guarantee that ) . Some LTI-specified fields use the prefix lis_; this refers to the IMS Learning Information Services standard from which LTI inherits some properties

The first Q-object is generating the match , the rest of the filters should not remove the match even if they do not match anything .

We generate one INNER JOIN to D . The join is direct and not nullable so we can use INNER JOIN for it . However , we can NOT use INNER JOIN for the b->c join , as a->b is nullable .

Linear model fitted by minimizing a regularized empirical loss with SGDSGD stands for Stochastic Gradient Descent: the gradient of the loss is estimated each sample at a time and the model is updated along the way with a decreasing strength schedule ( aka learning rate ) . The regularizer is a penalty added to the loss function that shrinks model parameters towards the zero vector using either the squared euclidean norm L2 or the absolute norm L1 or a combination of both ( Elastic Net ) . If the parameter update crosses the 0 . 0 value because of the regularizer , the update is truncated to 0 . 0 to allow for learning sparse models and achieve online feature selection . This implementation works with data represented as dense numpy arrays of floating point values for the features . Read more in the :ref: ` User Guide <sgd> ` . Parameters ---------- loss : str , ' squared_loss ' , ' huber ' , ' epsilon_insensitive ' , \ or ' squared_epsilon_insensitive ' The loss function to be used . Defaults to ' squared_loss ' which refers to the ordinary least squares fit . ' huber ' modifies ' squared_loss ' to focus less on getting outliers correct by switching from squared to linear loss past a distance of epsilon . ' epsilon_insensitive ' ignores errors less than epsilon and is linear past that; this is the loss function used in SVR . ' squared_epsilon_insensitive ' is the same but becomes squared loss past a tolerance of epsilon . penalty : str , ' none ' , ' l2 ' , ' l1 ' , or ' elasticnet ' The penalty ( aka regularization term ) to be used . Defaults to ' l2 ' which is the standard regularizer for linear SVM models . ' l1 ' and ' elasticnet ' might bring sparsity to the model ( feature selection ) not achievable with ' l2 ' . alpha : float Constant that multiplies the regularization term . Defaults to 0 . 0001 Also used to compute learning_rate when set to ' optimal ' . l1_ratio : float The Elastic Net mixing parameter , with 0 <= l1_ratio <= 1 . l1_ratio=0 corresponds to L2 penalty , l1_ratio=1 to L1 . Defaults to 0 . 15 . fit_intercept : bool Whether the intercept should be estimated or not . If False , the data is assumed to be already centered . Defaults to True . n_iter : int , optional The number of passes over the training data ( aka epochs ) . The number of iterations is set to 1 if using partial_fit . Defaults to 5 . shuffle : bool , optional Whether or not the training data should be shuffled after each epoch . Defaults to True . random_state : int seed , RandomState instance , or None ( default ) The seed of the pseudo random number generator to use when shuffling the data . verbose : integer , optional The verbosity level . epsilon : float Epsilon in the epsilon-insensitive loss functions; only if ` loss ` is ' huber ' , ' epsilon_insensitive ' , or ' squared_epsilon_insensitive ' . For ' huber ' , determines the threshold at which it becomes less important to get the prediction exactly right . For epsilon-insensitive , any differences between the current prediction and the correct label are ignored if they are less than this threshold . learning_rate : string , optional The learning rate: constant: eta = eta0 optimal: eta = 1 . 0/ ( alpha * t ) invscaling: eta = eta0 / pow ( t , power_t ) [ default ] eta0 : double , optional The initial learning rate [ default 0 . 01 ] . power_t : double , optional The exponent for inverse scaling learning rate [ default 0 . 25 ] . warm_start : bool , optional When set to True , reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as initialization , otherwise , just erase the previous solution . average : bool or int , optional When set to True , computes the averaged SGD weights and stores the result in the ` ` coef_ ` ` attribute . If set to an int greater than 1 , averaging will begin once the total number of samples seen reaches average . So ` ` average=10 will ` ` begin averaging after seeing 10 samples . Attributes ---------- coef_ : array , shape ( n_features , ) Weights assigned to the features . intercept_ : array , shape ( 1 , ) The intercept term . average_coef_ : array , shape ( n_features , ) Averaged weights assigned to the features . average_intercept_ : array , shape ( 1 , ) The averaged intercept term . Examples -------- >>> import numpy as np >>> from sklearn import linear_model >>> n_samples , n_features = 10 , 5 >>> np . random . seed ( 0 ) >>> y = np . random . randn ( n_samples ) >>> X = np . random . randn ( n_samples , n_features ) >>> clf = linear_model .

Perform the caching that gives this loader its name . Often many of the templates attempted will be missing , so memory use is of concern here . To keep it in check , caching behavior is a little complicated when a template is not found . See ticket 26306 for more details . With template debugging disabled , cache the TemplateDoesNotExist class for every missing template and raise a new instance of it after fetching it from the cache . With template debugging enabled , a unique TemplateDoesNotExist object is cached for each missing template to preserve debug data . When raising an exception , Python sets __traceback__ , __context__ , and __cause__ attributes on it . Those attributes can contain references to all sorts of objects up the call chain and caching them creates a memory leak . Thus , unraised copies of the exceptions are cached and copies of those copies are raised after they ' re fetched from the cache .

A random forest regressor . A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and use averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting . The sub-sample size is always the same as the original input sample size but the samples are drawn with replacement if ` bootstrap=True ` ( default ) . Read more in the :ref: ` User Guide <forest> ` . Parameters ---------- n_estimators : integer , optional ( default=10 ) The number of trees in the forest . criterion : string , optional ( default= " mse " ) The function to measure the quality of a split . The only supported criterion is " mse " for the mean squared error . max_features : int , float , string or None , optional ( default= " auto " ) The number of features to consider when looking for the best split: - If int , then consider ` max_features ` features at each split . - If float , then ` max_features ` is a percentage and ` int ( max_features * n_features ) ` features are considered at each split . - If " auto " , then ` max_features=n_features ` . - If " sqrt " , then ` max_features=sqrt ( n_features ) ` . - If " log2 " , then ` max_features=log2 ( n_features ) ` . - If None , then ` max_features=n_features ` . Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one valid partition of the node samples is found , even if it requires to effectively inspect more than ` ` max_features ` ` features . max_depth : integer or None , optional ( default=None ) The maximum depth of the tree . If None , then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples . Ignored if ` ` max_leaf_nodes ` ` is not None . min_samples_split : int , float , optional ( default=2 ) The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node: - If int , then consider ` min_samples_split ` as the minimum number . - If float , then ` min_samples_split ` is a percentage and ` ceil ( min_samples_split * n_samples ) ` are the minimum number of samples for each split . min_samples_leaf : int , float , optional ( default=1 ) The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node: - If int , then consider ` min_samples_leaf ` as the minimum number . - If float , then ` min_samples_leaf ` is a percentage and ` ceil ( min_samples_leaf * n_samples ) ` are the minimum number of samples for each node . min_weight_fraction_leaf : float , optional ( default=0 . ) The minimum weighted fraction of the input samples required to be at a leaf node . max_leaf_nodes : int or None , optional ( default=None ) Grow trees with ` ` max_leaf_nodes ` ` in best-first fashion . Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity . If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes . If not None then ` ` max_depth ` ` will be ignored . bootstrap : boolean , optional ( default=True ) Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees . oob_score : bool , optional ( default=False ) whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the R^2 on unseen data . n_jobs : integer , optional ( default=1 ) The number of jobs to run in parallel for both ` fit ` and ` predict ` . If -1 , then the number of jobs is set to the number of cores . random_state : int , RandomState instance or None , optional ( default=None ) If int , random_state is the seed used by the random number generator; If RandomState instance , random_state is the random number generator; If None , the random number generator is the RandomState instance used by ` np . random ` . verbose : int , optional ( default=0 ) Controls the verbosity of the tree building process . warm_start : bool , optional ( default=False ) When set to ` ` True ` ` , reuse the solution of the previous call to fit and add more estimators to the ensemble , otherwise , just fit a whole new forest . Attributes ---------- estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeRegressor The collection of fitted sub-estimators . feature_importances_ : array of shape = [ n_features ] The feature importances ( the higher , the more important the feature ) . n_features_ : int The number of features when ` ` fit ` ` is performed . n_outputs_ : int The number of outputs when ` ` fit ` ` is performed . oob_score_ : float Score of the training dataset obtained using an out-of-bag estimate . oob_prediction_ : array of shape = [ n_samples ] Prediction computed with out-of-bag estimate on the training set .

Multi-task Lasso model trained with L1/L2 mixed-norm as regularizerThe optimization objective for Lasso is:: ( 1 / ( 2 * n_samples ) ) * ||Y - XW||^2_Fro + alpha * ||W||_21 Where:: ||W||_21 = \sum_i \sqrt { \sum_j w_ { ij } ^2 } i . e . the sum of norm of each row . Read more in the :ref: ` User Guide <multi_task_lasso> ` . Parameters ---------- alpha : float , optional Constant that multiplies the L1/L2 term . Defaults to 1 . 0 fit_intercept : boolean whether to calculate the intercept for this model . If set to false , no intercept will be used in calculations ( e . g . data is expected to be already centered ) . normalize : boolean , optional , default False If True , the regressors X will be normalized before regression . This parameter is ignored when ` fit_intercept ` is set to False . When the regressors are normalized , note that this makes the hyperparameters learnt more robust and almost independent of the number of samples . The same property is not valid for standardized data . However , if you wish to standardize , please use ` preprocessing . StandardScaler ` before calling ` fit ` on an estimator with ` normalize=False ` . copy_X : boolean , optional , default True If ` ` True ` ` , X will be copied; else , it may be overwritten . max_iter : int , optional The maximum number of iterations tol : float , optional The tolerance for the optimization: if the updates are smaller than ` ` tol ` ` , the optimization code checks the dual gap for optimality and continues until it is smaller than ` ` tol ` ` . warm_start : bool , optional When set to ` ` True ` ` , reuse the solution of the previous call to fit as initialization , otherwise , just erase the previous solution . selection : str , default ' cyclic ' If set to ' random ' , a random coefficient is updated every iteration rather than looping over features sequentially by default . This ( setting to ' random ' ) often leads to significantly faster convergence especially when tol is higher than 1e-4 random_state : int , RandomState instance , or None ( default ) The seed of the pseudo random number generator that selects a random feature to update . Useful only when selection is set to ' random ' . Attributes ---------- coef_ : array , shape ( n_tasks , n_features ) parameter vector ( W in the cost function formula ) intercept_ : array , shape ( n_tasks , ) independent term in decision function . n_iter_ : int number of iterations run by the coordinate descent solver to reach the specified tolerance . Examples -------- >>> from sklearn import linear_model >>> clf = linear_model . MultiTaskLasso ( alpha=0 . 1 ) >>> clf . fit ( [ [ 0 , 0 ] , [ 1 , 1 ] , [ 2 , 2 ] ] , [ [ 0 , 0 ] , [ 1 , 1 ] , [ 2 , 2 ] ] ) MultiTaskLasso ( alpha=0 . 1 , copy_X=True , fit_intercept=True , max_iter=1000 , normalize=False , random_state=None , selection= ' cyclic ' , tol=0 . 0001 , warm_start=False ) >>> print ( clf . coef_ ) [ [ 0 . 89393398 0 . ] [ 0 . 89393398 0 . ] ] >>> print ( clf . intercept_ ) [ 0 . 10606602 0 . 10606602 ] See also -------- Lasso , MultiTaskElasticNet Notes ----- The algorithm used to fit the model is coordinate descent . To avoid unnecessary memory duplication the X argument of the fit method should be directly passed as a Fortran-contiguous numpy array .

Sometimes it ' s necessary to have multiple forms display on the same HTML page , or multiple copies of the same form . We can accomplish this with form prefixes .

One way to think about this is " namespaces for HTML forms " . Notice that in the data argument , each field ' s key has the prefix , in this case ' person1 ' , prepended to the actual field name .

( no strict check , as multiple indexes are possible ) Find the index for this field Change check constraints? Have they renamed the column? Next , start accumulating actions to do Type change? When changing a column NULL constraint to NOT NULL with a given default value , we need to perform 4 steps: 1 . Add a default for new incoming writes 2 . Update existing NULL rows with new default 3 . Replace NULL constraint with NOT NULL 4 . Drop the default again . Default change? Some databases can ' t take defaults as a parameter ( oracle ) If this is the case , the individual schema backend should implement prepare_default Nullability change? The field is nullable in the database anyway , leave it alone Only if we have a default and there is a change from NULL to NOT NULL If we don ' t have to do a 4-way default alteration we can directly run a ( NOT ) NULL alteration Combine actions together if we can ( e . g . postgres ) Apply those actions Update existing rows with default value Since we didn ' t run a NOT NULL change before we need to do it now Added a unique? Added an index? Type alteration on primary key? Then we need to alter the column referring to us . Changed to become primary key? Note that we don ' t detect unsetting of a PK , as we assume another field will always come along and replace it . First , drop the old PK Make the new one Update all referencing columns Handle our type alters on the other end of rels from the PK stuff above Does it have a foreign key?

Atomic dtype objects are interned by their default constructor: np . dtype ( ' f8 ' ) is np . dtype ( ' f8 ' ) This interning is not maintained by a pickle . loads + pickle . dumps cycle , because __reduce__ uses copy=True in the dtype constructor . This non-deterministic behavior causes the internal memoizer of the hasher to generate different hash values depending on the history of the dtype object . To prevent the hash from being sensitive to this , we use . descr which is a full ( and never interned ) description of the array dtype according to the numpy doc .

Compute the mean Silhouette Coefficient of all samples . The Silhouette Coefficient is calculated using the mean intra-cluster distance ( ` ` a ` ` ) and the mean nearest-cluster distance ( ` ` b ` ` ) for each sample . The Silhouette Coefficient for a sample is ` ` ( b - a ) / max ( a , b ) ` ` . To clarify , ` ` b ` ` is the distance between a sample and the nearest cluster that the sample is not a part of . Note that Silhouette Coefficent is only defined if number of labels is 2 <= n_labels <= n_samples - 1 . This function returns the mean Silhouette Coefficient over all samples . To obtain the values for each sample , use :func: ` silhouette_samples ` . The best value is 1 and the worst value is -1 . Values near 0 indicate overlapping clusters . Negative values generally indicate that a sample has been assigned to the wrong cluster , as a different cluster is more similar . Read more in the :ref: ` User Guide <silhouette_coefficient> ` . Parameters ---------- X : array [ n_samples_a , n_samples_a ] if metric == " precomputed " , or , \ [ n_samples_a , n_features ] otherwise Array of pairwise distances between samples , or a feature array . labels : array , shape = [ n_samples ] Predicted labels for each sample . metric : string , or callable The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a feature array . If metric is a string , it must be one of the options allowed by :func: ` metrics . pairwise . pairwise_distances <sklearn . metrics . pairwise . pairwise_distances> ` . If X is the distance array itself , use ` ` metric= " precomputed " ` ` . sample_size : int or None The size of the sample to use when computing the Silhouette Coefficient on a random subset of the data . If ` ` sample_size is None ` ` , no sampling is used . random_state : integer or numpy . RandomState , optional The generator used to randomly select a subset of samples if ` ` sample_size is not None ` ` . If an integer is given , it fixes the seed . Defaults to the global numpy random number generator . ` **kwds ` : optional keyword parameters Any further parameters are passed directly to the distance function . If using a scipy . spatial . distance metric , the parameters are still metric dependent . See the scipy docs for usage examples . Returns ------- silhouette : float Mean Silhouette Coefficient for all samples . References ---------- . . [ 1 ] ` Peter J . Rousseeuw ( 1987 ) .
